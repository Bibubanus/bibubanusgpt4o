# PROOF_LOG

This proof log documents the architectural decisions taken for the ULTIMAI reasoning‑infrastructure and cites the sources (research papers, articles, archives) that support each decision.

| Decision / Implementation | Supporting reasoning (cross‑reference & sources) |
|---|---|
| **Adopting a multi‑agent reasoning architecture (Meta‑Agent, Critic, Reality Injector, Quarantine, Chrono, etc.)** | The ULTIMAI archives propose a multi‑agent structure. Research into large‑language‑model agent systems (e.g., LangGraph) shows that breaking a single LLM into several specialized agents improves modularity, scalability, and supervision【906438729630143†L116-L139】. Different multi‑agent topologies (network, supervisor/hierarchical) support flexible communication patterns【906438729630143†L145-L160】. |
| **Extending the Memetic Engine with population‑based evolution, multi‑objective optimization and stagnation detection** | The reasoning files specify a memetic algorithm; memetic algorithms combine evolutionary search with local search, offering robustness and improved convergence【230422289242979†L41-L87】. Population‑based evolution and stagnation rollback were implemented in `memetic_algorithm.py` to prevent stagnation. |
| **Incorporating Knowledge Graphs & Graph Reasoning for explainability and scaling** | GraphAgent‑Reasoner demonstrates that decomposing graph reasoning into node‑centric tasks across multiple agents yields near‑perfect accuracy on polynomial‑time problems and scales to graphs with >1 000 nodes【166755538859472†L20-L37】. KG4XAI notes that knowledge graphs provide semantic grounding, allow constraints enforcement and explainable reasoning across pre-, in- and post-model stages, enhancing trust and transparency【850674227268130†L45-L75】. |
| **Implementing Quarantine and Critic modules to detect parasitic reasoning, blind spots and memetic attacks** | ULTIMAI archives emphasize quarantine to isolate reasoning‑threads with high variance and reintroduce them after evaluation. Critic‑Agent detects flaws and blind‑spots. This aligns with memetic theory to quarantine harmful memes and maintain the integrity of the reasoning graph. |
| **Adding a Meta‑Agent for oversight, self‑test and rollback** | The reasoning logs show a need for a coordinating agent to manage other agents, detect stagnation and decide rollbacks. This is consistent with supervisory architectures described in multi‑agent frameworks (LangGraph)【906438729630143†L145-L160】. |
| **Implementing Explainability features (multi‑step explanations and explanation cards)** | Research into KG4XAI highlights the importance of knowledge graphs for explainable AI, which support feature extraction, relation extraction, knowledge integration and natural language explanations【850674227268130†L45-L75】. This justifies adding `multi_step_explanation` and producing explanation traces. |
| **Automating ingestion from external sources (GitHub, ArXiv, StackOverflow)** | To enrich reasoning graphs with fresh data, connectors to external sources were stubbed in `integration.py`. The design follows practices of retrieval augmented generation and research agent systems (e.g., GraphAgent‑Reasoner). |
| **Developing CI/CD with test suites and GitHub Actions** | Modern software development emphasizes automated testing and continuous integration. A workflow (`ci.yml`) unzips the agent code, installs dependencies and runs `pytest`. This ensures that modifications to reasoning modules (memetic engine, meta agent, quarantine) are validated automatically. |
| **Preparing cross‑reference log and proof log to document usage of archives and research** | To maintain transparency, files `CROSS_REFERENCE_LOG.md` and `PROOF_LOG.md` map each reasoning archive or file to how it was used and cite research sources for each design choice. This provides accountability and reproducibility. |
