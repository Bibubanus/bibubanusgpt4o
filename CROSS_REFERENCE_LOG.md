# Cross-Reference Log

This log documents which materials from the provided archives, logs, PDFs, and research were used to build the integrated reasoning infrastructure.

| Source | Location | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Хронология разработки.zip** | extracted_new, dev_chronology_main | Provided early reasoning traces, memetic experiments, and NoeticCore prototypes. Used to design the memetic engine, quarantine module and critic agent. |
| **Хронология разработки 1,1.zip** | extracted_new2 | Included updated ULTIMAI modules such as reasoning_modulator.js, meta_synthesizer.js, and noetic interface. Used to implement dynamic axis selection, meta-synthesis and reality-injector patterns. |
| **agent_research2.zip** | agent_research2 directory | Full implementation of ULTIMAI architecture (evo-core, memetic engine, quarantine, critic, meta-agent, XAI). Integrated into the GitHub repository as a compressed bundle and unpacked at CI runtime. |
| **Агентное исследование.txt** | root / share | Provided summarised reasoning logs, philosophies and blind-spot analyses. Helped identify areas of improvement and served as guidance for new modules. |
| **НАГИТХАБ!.txt** | root / share | Contained user instructions on auditing, integration, cross-reference and proof logs, and GitHub deployment requirements. |
| **Reasoning Log.pdf** | repository | Historical PDF report summarising earlier reasoning experiments; preserved for context. |
| **External research** | GraphAgent‑Reasoner【166755538859472†L20-L37】, KG4XAI【850674227268130†L45-L75】, memetic algorithms【230422289242979†L41-L87】 | Informed design decisions: multi-agent graph decomposition, knowledge graph based explainability, memetic evolution and population-based optimisation. |
