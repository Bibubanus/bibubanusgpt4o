# Local run on 2025-07-26

This log records the steps performed locally to prepare the ULTIMAI reasoning infrastructure for deployment when direct write access to the GitHub repository was not available.

## Preparation

* Extracted the `ULTIMAI_updated.zip` archive into a working directory.
* Verified the presence of key files and directories: `ultimai/` package modules, scripts, tests, data, docs and CI workflow definitions.
* Added a `networkx_stub.py` to provide a fallback when the `networkx` package is missing.  Adjusted degree centrality computation so that the sum of centrality scores equals the number of nodes.
* Updated the Makefile to set `PYTHONPATH` when running tests or scripts.
* Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to automate testing, graph/report generation and GitHub Pages deployment.
* Added `docs/troubleshooting.md` to capture common issues and their resolutions.

## Selfâ€‘audit and stress test

Commands executed:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=ULTIMAI python ULTIMAI/tests/run_tests.py
PYTHONPATH=ULTIMAI python ULTIMAI/scripts/generate_graph.py --input ULTIMAI/data/seeds.json --output ULTIMAI/build/graph/graph.json
PYTHONPATH=ULTIMAI python ULTIMAI/scripts/dump_report.py --graph ULTIMAI/build/graph/graph.json --output ULTIMAI/build/report/report.md
```

All unit tests passed.  The graph generation script produced a JSON file and, due to missing graph drawing libraries, a text representation (`graph.png.txt`).  The report script computed metrics (nodes: 3, edges: 3, score variance: ~0.0816) and suggested decomposing hubs and extending dead ends.

## Pending actions

Without write permissions to the GitHub repository, it was not possible to unpack the archive and commit the updated structure.  The archive `ULTIMAI_updated.zip` must be extracted and committed to the repository root to replace outdated workflows and enable the new CI/CD pipeline.  Once merged, the `CI` workflow should run tests, generate the graph and report, upload artefacts, and deploy GitHub Pages.
