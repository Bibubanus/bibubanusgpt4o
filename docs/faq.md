# Frequently Asked Questions

**Why does the project avoid external dependencies?**

The environment in which ULTIMAI is developed may lack internet
access, making it difficult to install packages from PyPI.  To
ensure reproducibility, the core functionality relies solely on
Pythonâ€™s standard library.  Optional packages such as NetworkX,
pandas, matplotlib or pygraphviz can be installed to enhance
performance and visualisation but are not required.

**How do I visualise the reasoning graph?**

The `scripts/generate_graph.py` script will attempt to render the
graph using pygraphviz (Graphviz), falling back to matplotlib and
finally to a textual representation.  You can install these
packages if your environment allows (`sudo apt-get install
graphviz libgraphviz-dev` and `pip install matplotlib pygraphviz`).

**How do I contribute tests?**

Add new test files under `tests/` with names starting with
`test_`.  Tests should be functions prefixed with `test_` and may
optionally accept a single argument `tmp_path` which will be
supplied with a temporary directory by the test runner.

**How do I deploy GitHub Pages?**

The CI workflow builds the graph and report and deploys them via
GitHub Pages.  See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` for details.
