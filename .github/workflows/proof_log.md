# Proof log

This log provides evidence and justification for the architectural decisions and algorithms implemented in this repository.  Each section connects specific design choices to references found in the reasoning archives or external research.  Citations are provided using tether IDs.

## Reasoning graph representation

* **Directed multigraph with attributes**: Representing reasoning as a directed graph with labelled nodes and edges allows us to capture causal, temporal and semantic relationships between concepts.  The ULTIMAI archives extensively employ graph metaphors (e.g. “hypergraph reasoning”, “Zero‑Meme graph”) and the GraphAgent‑Reasoner framework demonstrates that decomposing graph reasoning into node‑centric tasks improves scalability and accuracy【166755538859472†L20-L37】.  Knowledge graphs used in XAI similarly store entities and relations to support explainable AI【928960283267357†L56-L114】.

* **Node attributes (label, type, source, score)**: Many archive files annotate ideas with metadata such as their origin (“ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ.txt”), their discipline (philosophical, technical, memetic) and their memetic strength.  Including these attributes in the graph enables filtering and analysis.  The “score” property allows us to implement quarantine and memetic mutations.


## Memetic algorithm

* **Hybrid global/local search**: Memetic algorithms combine evolutionary operators with local refinement, offering robustness and flexibility【230422289242979†L41-L87】.  The `MemeticEngine` applies random mutations to node scores and relations (global search) followed by local greedy optimisation using the critic.  This mirrors the conceptual evolution described in `evolution_god_analysis.md`, where ideas mutate and are refined through crises.

* **Score perturbation and edge addition**: Changing the importance of concepts and introducing new relations reflects memetic drift and recombination.  The design draws on the memetic experiments in the archives (e.g. “МЕМЫЭКОС3.txt”), where new memes emerge by combining existing concepts and by elevating or suppressing their influence.


## Critic and quarantine

* **Quality metrics**: The critic’s quality score combines edge density, mean node importance and inverse centralisation.  This is inspired by best practices in network analysis and ensures a balanced structure without oversimplification.  The archives highlight the dangers of over‑centralisation (e.g. “Бог становится операцией над структурами” in `evolution_god_analysis.md`) and the need for rich interconnections.

* **Blind spot detection**: Identifying isolated nodes, hubs and dead ends addresses issues raised in `koach_roma_analysis.md`, where the system fails to handle aggressive or paradoxical input due to blind spots.  The critic produces recommendations to integrate isolated nodes and extend dead‑end reasoning chains.

* **Quarantine threshold**: A default threshold of 0.35 is adopted based on trials in Python prototypes found in the ULTIMAI v4.4.1 scripts.  Nodes below this score are tagged as quarantined to prevent propagation of low‑quality memes.  This mechanism echoes the “quarantine” modules in those prototypes.


## Meta agent and modularity

* **Orchestration**: The `MetaAgent` coordinates ingestion, evolution, quarantine and audit.  This reflects the meta‑agent described in the conversation logs (e.g. `НАГИТХАБ!.txt`), where the user switches between modes (Meta‑Reasoning, Techno‑Synth, Critic‑Core) to achieve different goals.  Multi‑agent frameworks recommend such modularisation【906438729630143†L116-L139】.

* **Configurable iterations and thresholds**: Allowing users to configure memetic iterations and quarantine thresholds supports experimentation and tuning.  This adaptability is necessary given the diverse nature of the ULTIMAI data and aligns with the spirit of continuous evolution emphasised in the archives.


## Explainability and knowledge graph export

* **Shortest justification paths and concept summaries**: Providing simple explanations for how two concepts are connected improves transparency.  This idea is rooted in the KG4XAI methodology for explainable AI【850674227268130†L45-L75】, which emphasises narrative explanations and user‑friendly summaries.

* **Knowledge graph export**: Converting the reasoning graph into a knowledge‑graph schema makes it interoperable with tools such as temporal knowledge graphs and XAI systems【928960283267357†L56-L114】.  This also facilitates integration with existing research on Graphiti and other frameworks.


## External integrations

* **Data source stubs**: The `integration.py` module defines an interface for connecting to APIs.  This is informed by the user’s desire to pull data from GitHub and other services (as expressed in the conversation logs) and by the limitations of the current GitHub connector (read‑only).  The structure allows future developers to plug in connectors while keeping the core reasoning logic agnostic to the data source.


## Limitations and considerations

* **GitHub connector constraints**: The available API endpoints only permit reading from repositories; writing or committing changes must be done manually.  Our deployment instructions reflect this limitation by requiring the user to push code themselves.

* **Simplified memetic algorithm**: The current `MemeticEngine` operates on a single graph rather than a population of graphs.  It applies basic mutations and local search.  While adequate as a proof of concept, future work could implement a full population, crossover operations and multi‑objective fitness.

* **External data integration**: Integration hooks are placeholders.  Real implementations will need to handle authentication, rate limits and data cleaning.  Security and privacy considerations are outlined in `docs/deployment.md`.
